* How to run the program?

-> First, direct your terminal to the program's file path. Then, you can simply type in "python ./run_experiments.py rmat1517.gr rmat1517.extra rmat1517.output", which is an example. Basically, you can define the name of the output file whatever you want.

For example, "python ./run_experiments.py rmat1517.gr rmat1517.extra rmat1517.output".
